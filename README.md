### Java Hibernate Management Systems

This repository contains three minor projects developed using Java and Hibernate, each designed to manage different types of data effectively. These projects demonstrate the use of Java for application logic and Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM) and database interactions.

#### Projects Included:

1. **Library Management System**
   - A system to manage books, members, and borrowing records.
   - Features include adding, updating, deleting, and searching for books and members.

2. **Employee Management System**
   - A tool for managing employee records, including personal details, job titles, and departments.
   - Includes functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and querying employee data.

3. **Student Management System**
   - A system designed to manage student records, including enrollment, grades, and personal information.
   - Allows for adding, updating, deleting, and searching for student records.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Java:** Core application logic.
- **Hibernate:** Object-relational mapping and database operations.
- **SQL:** Database management.

#### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the specific project directory (`LibraryManagementSystem`, `EmployeeManagementSystem`, or `StudentManagementSystem`).
3. Set up your database and configure the Hibernate `hibernate.cfg.xml` file.
4. Use your preferred IDE or command line to compile and run the Java application.

#### Contribution:
Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or contribute to the projects.
